# Bikesharing 

## Summary 

The purpose of this project was to practice using Tableau, in conjunction with using Jupyter Notebooks, to take data, convert some it, and visualize the data. The story for the data is displayed here: [The tableau storyboard link.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chelsea.g.o.hara#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_Data_Challenge/OverviewStoryboard)

## Analysis 

### Dashboard 

The Dashboard is showing a snapshot of parameters: number of trips in August, 2019, the breakdown of gender and type of user, average trip by age, and starting and ending spots for the bikes. 

### Time: Duration, Peak hours, and Checkout times. 

When looking at the peak times, we can see that there are two peak times: one in the morning from 6 am to 9 am and one in the afternoon from 4pm to 7 pm. This correllates to when people head to work and then head home. This is supported by the heatmap of checkout times in the Trips by Weekday tab. 

Looking at the Checkout Times, at the peak of the curve, most trips are 5 minutes. This suggests that most trips are pretty quick (or maybe the customers realized they didn't need the bike and put it back after taking it out). 

When considering when to fix bikes, the bikes should be taken in for maintenance in the evening. The Bike Utlization bubble map can be used to the determine the order of which bikes need to be fixed (the bigger the bubble, the more it is used and should be fixed sooner rather than later). 

### Customers: Breakdown of parameters by gender. 

As seen on the dashboard, majority of the users are male, followed by female, and the smallest amount are unknown gender. This is supported by the breakdown of checkout times of users by gender as well as the weekday heatmaps by gender. However, when looking at the Weekday Trips by Users and Gender, the heatmap shows that most subscribers are male, whereas the customers seem to be evenly split between male, female, and unknown. 

If Citibike wanted to increase their subscriber numbers, than it is suggested they focus on customers who are female and/or unknown gender.
